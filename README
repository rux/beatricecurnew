Hello

This is the website for Beatrice Curnew, a British actress.  If you're reading this
you're probably not a regular visitor to her site, you're more likely a rails
developer or someone who happens to be looking at my github account.  The code
for this simple site is all sitting in the public domain because I couldn't
think of a reason for hiding it.

Note to self... if the postgress complains, just do a 

pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres94 -l logfile start

or something similar.  Pg's not being used, but I can't be bothered to unpick it.
