Hello

This is the website for Beatrice Curnew, a British actress.  If you're reading this
you're probably not a regular visitor to her site, you're more likely a rails
developer or someone who happens to be looking at my github account.  The code
for this simple site is all sitting in the public domain because I couldn't
think of a reason for hiding it. Yay open source.  I remember being frustrated
when I was starting out using rails that there were no super-simple sites out
there that I could have a look at and examine, so I guess I'm scratching that
temporal itch there.  This is a site that doesn't have a database or try to
be a live blogging platform or anything, it just sits on heroku and serves static
content.  Not everyone's ideal for a rails powered site, but there's still some
mileage in the KISS principle.
